# Unit 0 Lesson 1 Assessment - Introduction to Git and GitHub

## Directions
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone it to your local repository.
3. Change directories into the `unit-0-assessment/assessments/` directory.
4. Inside of this directory, create a new markdown file that you will use to write your question responses. Use the naming convention `firstname_git_assessment.md`. Be sure to use markdown to nicely format your questions and responses.
5. When you are finished with the assessment and are confident in your answers stage and commit your changes. Then, push up your changes to your own fork of the `unit-0-assessment/` directory. Lastly, open a pull request. This will notify me that you have completed the exam.

## Assessment Questions
* What is the purpose of Git?
* What is the purpose of GitHub?
* What is a _commit_ and how does this differ from saving a document or file?
* What does the `git add` command do?
* What does the `git push` command do?
* What does it mean to _fork_ a repository?
* What does the `git clone` command do and why would we ever use it?


## Assessment Criteria
I will be grading your assessments on two criteria:
1. **Clarity of Communication**
  
  I expect you to write in complete sentences while paying close attention to grammar and spelling. For our assessments, how you communicate is just as important as _what_ you communicate. Each of the questions above can be answered in 1-3 sentences. They should not be much longer than that. If you are taking much longer to get your point across, it is probably an indicator that you have some more studying to do. ðŸ¤“
2. **Accuracy of Your Mental Model**
  
  I am not testing your ability to memorize definitions that come from a book. By answering these questions in your own words, you are communicating to me that you understand the _what_ and _why_ behind each of these key concepts. Remember: **Your words are your world.** Use the vocabulary of the unit to communicate with accuracy and precision.
